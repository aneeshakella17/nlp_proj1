We conduct primary research to develop a list of vendors that meet our  
criteria for evaluation in this market. From that initial pool of vendo-
rs, we narrow our final list. We choose these vendors based on 1) produ-
ct fit; 2) customer success; and 3) Forrester client demand. We elimina-
te vendors that have limited customer references and products that don't
 fit the scope of our evaluation. Vendors marked as incomplete particip-
ants met our defined inclusion criteria but declined to participate or  
contributed only partially to the evaluation. 
 
After examining past research, user needs assessments, and vendor and e-
xpert interviews, we develop the initial evaluation criteria. To evalua-
te the vendors and their products against our set of criteria, we gather
 details of product qualifications through a combination of lab evaluat-
ions, questionnaires, demos, and/or discussions with client references. 
We send evaluations to the vendors for their review, and we adjust the  
evaluations to provide the most accurate view of vendor offerings and s-
trategies.
