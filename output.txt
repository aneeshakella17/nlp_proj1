We conduct primary research to develop a list of vendors that meet our  
criteria for evaluation in this market. From that initial pool of vendo-
rs, we narrow our final list. We choose these vendors based on 1) produ-
ct fit; 2) customer success; and 3) Forrester client demand. We elimina-
te vendors that have limited customer references and products that don't
 fit the scope of our evaluation. Vendors marked as incomplete particip-
ants met our defined inclusion criteria but declined to participate or  
contributed only partially to the evaluation. 
After examining past res-
earch, user needs assessments, and vendor and expert interviews, we dev-
elop the initial evaluation criteria. To evaluate the vendors and their 
products against our set of criteria, we gather details of product qual-
ifications through a combination of lab evaluations, questionnaires, de-
mos, and/or discussions with client references. We send evaluations to  
the vendors for their review, and we adjust the evaluations to provide  
the most accurate view of vendor offerings and strategies.
